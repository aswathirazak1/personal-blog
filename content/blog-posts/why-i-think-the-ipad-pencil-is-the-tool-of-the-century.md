Half a day into unboxing my iPad air and I am totally fangirl-ing over this app. Moroccan inspired geometric art and mandalas that I 'pinterest' a hundred times over but never actually have the patience to sit down and make - I made one in less than an hour. Procreate is a total game-changer for digital artists. I haven't explored it in totality. But here are my first impressions -

### It makes you feel like the 4 year old version of you.

The gesture controlled actions are so beautifully designed - they become second nature really fast. My favourite is dragging and dropping color to fill - It's like that feeling when you first dipped your fingers in paint.

### Better than Cmd+Z

Undo and redo are two and three finger taps respectively. Hell, I don't even know the keyboard shortcut on desktop for redo.

### Auto-correcting curves and lines for the win!

If you hold a drawn circle or oval long enough, it self corrects. So do lines, rectangles, triangles and other polygons. No more using shape tools - I'm sold!

### Layer controls are eaaaasy.

Masking, locking transparency, moving, deleting - these are the most frequently used actions. These are gesture controlled and feel frictionless.

### Drop images directly from browser

You can split screen in the middle of work and look for inspiration, drag and drop it from your browser directly in your canvas and it'll paste into a new layer.

### A sinful symmetry grid

The radial grid = instant gratification. No kidding. You do 1/8th of the work and watch the kaleidoscope-ic magic happen. There is something very very very satisfying about a perfectly symmetrical composition.

## Honestly, I feel guilty.

This was the thought on my mind that was haunting and thrilling all at once. I remember in design school when our professors were always trying to make us understand the value of doing everything from illustration to type design by hand first with a pencil and paper. They were so adamant that we had to go through all the pain they went through to learn what they did, instead of jumping directly into the easy digital worlds of our generation. There was so much emphasis on skill, practice and persistence - it was not enough to just have good ideas.

But today, I feel that gap slowly tightening. Do I really need to draw perfect circles any more to create perfectly cylindrical perspectives? Do I really need to practice patience to draw mandalas?

There is so much power in automation, and there is so much information and easy access to inspiration and references online today - unlike for my older professors. A tool like procreate enables the creative process without a lot of the friction that was hitherto between me and my potential creation.
