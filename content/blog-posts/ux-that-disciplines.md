A study: Capsule wardrobe - limit to 30 pcs Drawing exercies - draw gestures with 3 lines? Writing apps - write 300 words continuously without stopping - 300 words a day etc? What if pinterest limited the number of stuff you can save into a single board??? Will you be extra diligent about what to choose?
